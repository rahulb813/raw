# Basics of Supply Chain

-   Supply Chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product, and the supply chain represents the steps it takes to get the product or service to the customer.
-   The path is as follows:
-   Supplier -> Vendor -> Transportation -> Distribution Centers -> Retailer -> Consumer

## Major topics are as follows:

### Demand: It's a customer's willingness and ability to consume a product

### Supply: The amount of product or service that is available to the customers

### Supply Chain:

-   <b>Supply Chain Management (SCM)</b>: It's the management of flow of goods and services and includes all processes that transform raw materials into final products.
-   <b>Supply Chain Optimization (SCO)</b>: It's the application of processes and tools that ensure the optimal operation of manufacturing and distribution of a supply chain.

### 5 drivers of Supply Chain:

-   <b>Production</b>: What, how and when to produce
-   <b>Inventory</b>: How much to produce and store
-   <b>Location</b>: Where is the best place to perform an activity
-   <b>Transportation</b>: How and when to move a product
-   <b>Information</b>: The basis of making decisions

### 4 Strategic Elements of Supply Chain:

-   <b>Capacity</b>: How much amount of product or service the supply chain can produce at a given time.
-   <b>Responsiveness</b>: How quickly the supply chain can provide the product or service to the customer.
-   <b>Flexibility</b>: How quickly the supply chain can scale up or down based on changes in customer demand.
-   <b>Cost</b>: Amount of money and resources it takes to operate the supply chain in an overall manner.

### Supply Chain Priorities

### Categories of Supply Chain Operations

-   <b>Plan</b>: Refers to the planning operations of the other three categories.
-   <b>Source</b>: The necessary activities to acquire the inputs to create products and services.
-   <b>Make</b>: Refers to operations required to develop and create products and services that the supply chain provides
-   <b>Deliver</b>: Operations related to activities that are a part of customer orders and delivering products.

### Goals of a supply chain

#### To match the demand with the supply

#### Which is done using the following steps

-   <b>Demand Planning</b>: Forecast the demand of products accurately that is supported by the supply chain
-   <b>Supply Planning</b>: The apropriate and efficient use of the inventory to meet the forecasted demand.
-   <b>Transportation Management</b>: Allows for the flow of management of goods across the network
-   <b>Customer Value</b>: To make the manufactured product reach the customer without any significant increase in price and also meeting the customer's requirements.

### Integrated Supply Chain

It is a process where every phase from obtaining raw materials to production, quality control to packaging, distribution of supply to delivery is <b>NOT</b> separable.

## Supply Chain Activities
### Planning
- Strategic planning of the supply chain
- In terms of weeks, months, quarters, years.
- Includes types of planning like demand planning, supply planning sales and operational planning and manufacturing planning.

### Execution
- Operational tasks in support of the supply chain
- In terms of months, weeks, days, hours, minutes
- Includes types of task execution like order fulfilment, warehousing and transportation.
